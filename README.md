# QRA_Odisee_Lesson
QRA-code for teaching.

Open-source project for teachers. 

Organise a lesson with AR-technology.

Used code is Node.js (javascript) and HTML, CSS. 

-------------------------------------------------

The index  page starts with reading a qr-code (the link that needs to be viewed in AR). 
If a match the "iframe.html" gets loaded and shows your info. 

You can generate your own images by using the QRAmaker (see static folder). 
Do note: for an easy to read qr-code make sure you host your index file with the images. 
         If so, you can use a spatial for the qr-home in the QrA_Maker.
