# QRA_Odisee_Lesson
QRA-code for teaching.

Open-source project for teachers. 

Organise a lesson with AR-technology.

Used code is Node.js (javascript) and HTML, CSS. 

-------------------------------------------------

The index  page starts with reading a qr-code (the link that needs to be viewed in AR). 
If there is a match the "iframe.html" gets loaded and then shows your info. 

You can generate your own images by using the QRAmaker (see static folder). 
Do note: 
for an easy to read qr-code make sure you host your index file with the images. 
If so, you can use a "space-character" for the qr-home in the QrA_Maker. 

You can find all images (and QRA-codes) inside the folder static/A. 
The folder A is short. We need to make a short path so the QR-scanning will be easier and less error-prone. 

-------------------------------------------------

What makes this project like nothing else: 
you can generate everything you want in AR. 
A simple image or a complex presentation, no problem! 
You only need to know some coding if you want to show an AR-link with more than just existing formats.
